# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** A non-technical person can record a multi-step screen routine in under 2 minutes and replay it reliably on any resolution — "Muscle Memory: Show it once, it never forgets."
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Overlay Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Overlay Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Roadmap created, ready for Phase 1 planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Overlay built fresh (reference only from existing code) — existing overlay lacks cinematic animations
- DPI correctness must be established in Phase 1 before any recording logic is wired — catastrophically expensive to fix later
- Rich TUI is a sequential pre-launch gate — it exits before QApplication() is created; two event loops never coexist
- FastAPI uvicorn runs as daemon thread with `install_signal_handlers = False`

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Hide-before-screenshot timing gap on Windows DWM — minimum 80ms sleep after processEvents() required; build configurable `capture_delay_ms` in YAML config
- [Phase 1]: QObject + QGraphicsItem multiple-inheritance MRO ordering (QObject must come first) — validate BorderGlowItem pattern with minimal prototype before building all animation items on top of it
- [Phase 1]: Frosted glass approach — fake semi-transparent is V1 recommendation; validate visual quality early on Windows before full HUD build-out
- [Phase 10]: prompt_user timeout behavior under unattended replay not yet defined (timeout? skip? fail?)
- [Phase 10]: MCP tool description quality depends on FastAPI route docstring curation — budget extra time
